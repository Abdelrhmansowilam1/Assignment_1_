## 🎯 Assignment Specifications Met

### Model Architecture
- ✅ Standard encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- ✅ 2 encoder layers, 2 decoder layers
- ✅ 4 attention heads
- ✅ Embedding dimension = 128
- ✅ Vocabulary size = 1000 (reduced for debugging)
- ✅ Feed-forward dimension = 512

### Required Snapshots (43 Total)
- ✅ **Snapshots 1-5**: Input & Embedding processing
- ✅ **Snapshots 6-19**: Encoder layer processing
- ✅ **Snapshots 20-40**: Decoder layer processing
- ✅ **Snapshots 41-43**: Final output processing

### Sample Data
- ✅ Input: "The quick brown fox" (token IDs: [1, 45, 123, 67, 89])
- ✅ Target: "Le renard brun rapide" (token IDs: [2, 156, 234, 78, 145])

## 🚀 Ready for Student Use

### Next Steps for Students:
1. **Open PyCharm**
2. **Configure WSL as Python interpreter** (follow `setup_wsl_pycharm.md`)
3. **Open `debug_transformer.py`**
4. **Set breakpoints at all 43 marked locations**
5. **Run in debug mode** (`Shift + F9`)
6. **Capture screenshots** at each breakpoint
7. **Answer guiding questions** in the report

### Commands to Run:
```bash
# Test setup
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/IT_level4/Assignment && source venv/bin/activate && python3 test_setup.py"

# Run debugging session
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/IT_level4/Assignment && source venv/bin/activate && python3 debug_transformer.py"
